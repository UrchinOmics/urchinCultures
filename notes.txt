the goal of this work is to integrate the scRNAseq from the cell cultures with the scRNAseq developmental atlas. 
we intend to show that cells in culture co-cluster with developmental cell types. 
however, it is quite possible that the cultured cells will be rather distinct. 

either way, the goal is the same. integrate the data and put them onto the same umap space. 
then we do clustering and ask if clusters are composed of cells both from cultures and the atlas, or whether they're separate. 

Bash scripts are numbered in the order they were run. 
first up, i made a reference transcriptome with cellranger using annotations that I pulled from NCBI. (1_mkrefgenome.sh)
I put all the reads into the same folder and generated a sample list. these are just base sample names. (2_mvreads.sh)

Submitted cellranger count jobs for each sample via sbatch wrap. see scripts/3_count.sh for specific count parameters. (3_count.sh)

Clean things up a little. Making an output directory for cellranger and copy the output over there.  


at this point, we move into R. See scRNA_seq_integration_analysis.R
